Add the cron event handler in init method:

add_action('rui_cron_job', array('Rapid_URL_Indexer', 'process_cron_jobs'));
add_action('rui_process_api_request', array('Rapid_URL_Indexer', 'process_api_request'), 10, 3);


The implementation provided above covers a substantial part of the plugin's functionality. However, due to the complexity and the requirement of multiple interactions, the implementation needs to be continuously tested and adjusted.

Further enhancements may include:

- Implementing proper error handling and retries for API requests.
- Developing detailed project management interfaces for both admin and customers.
- Implementing email notification systems.
- Adding comprehensive logging and reporting mechanisms.
- Writing unit tests to ensure the plugin's reliability and maintainability.

The above code serves as a foundational starting point, from which these enhancements can be developed and integrated.
